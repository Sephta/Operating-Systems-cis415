### The repo contains the source files for my work in Operating Systems at the UO

If you are a student in this course, do not copy code, do not use this repo, the school will flag you for plagerism. I highly recomend that you attempt the projects before reading the source files in this repo.

#### Projects:

* Pseudo-Shell CLI
* Workload Process Scheduler
* Publisher-Subscriber Asynchronous Thread Management Solution
