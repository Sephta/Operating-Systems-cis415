# Psuedo Shell Environmnet

## Project 1 for CIS 415 (Operating Systems) @ University of Oregon

In this project I was tasked with utilizing various Unix system calls to emulate common behavior in command line interfaces. The program was developed in C, inside of an arch linux virtual machine.

### Emulated Commands

* pwd - list the current working directory
* cd  - change the current directory
* ls  - list out the contents of the current directory
* mv  - move a file or directory
* cp  - copy a file to a new location
* [W.I.P]
